# CSC670PricelineSite
Along with my class parter, we used HTML and CSS to create a replica page of the Priceline website. We also used Adobe XD to create the website wireframe before coding it. This was done around July 2019. Feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on how to improve certain things. Thanks!
